You're in luck! Welcome to Markdown! Markdown is a lightweight text formatting language that you can use to style and format elements on plain documents. Markdown is one of the world's most popular markup languages, and for a reason - its simplicity. Compared to other glorified programs, Markdown doesn't make you move your mouse to click buttons. Instead, you use asterisks , underscores , and backticks to indicate which parts of the text should look different. You can even embed HTML directly into the doc, and it'll render like a webpage! When you save the document, it gets turned into a super visually pleasant, rich document. In this guide, markdown examples will appear in code blocks, then they will be rendered directly after. This will help you understand Markdown syntax and how it gets rendered. In this guide you will also learn by reading examples, and piecing the puzzle pieces together. That way you learn more, and it's a lot more fun! Before you start writing, it's important to note that text on multiple lines have to have one empty line in between them, otherwise they get squished into a single line. Keep that in mind! Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Useful tools One more thing... Check out MarkdownLivePreview.com , a very useful tool for previewing your Markdown documents before you're ready to publish them. Now we can finally get to the tutorials! Text flavours It's very easy to make *some parts of the text* italic and **other parts** bold. It's very easy to make some parts of the text italic and other parts bold. You can even _use_ __underscores__ in place of *asterisks!* It's __super__ *simple*. You can even use underscores in place of asterisks! It's super simple . Sweet styles Markdown Result Markdown Result *Italics* Italics __*Underline Italics*__ Underline Italics **Bold** Bold __**Underline Bold**__ Underline Bold ***Bold Italics*** Bold Italics Headers Adding titles, subtitles, and headers is very simple! # Just ## try ### using #### some ##### lovely ###### hashtags. Just try using some lovely hashtags. Optionally, you can also close headers with hashtags. This is purely cosmetic, and you can use it if you think it looks better. The amount of closing hashes doesn't need to match the amount of opening hashes. # This # ## looks ## ### lovely, ###### #### now #################################### ##### doesn't # ###### it? This looks lovely, now doesn't it? You can also write Large headers and Semi-large headers like so: LARGE HEADER ============ Semi-Large Header ----------------- LARGE HEADER Semi-Large Header Links There are two types of Markdown links: inline and reference. In Markdown on websites, links will open in the same tab. However, if you want to open the link in a new tab, you can do that! We'll get into that during the HTML part of this tutorial. Inline links Inline links are super easy and cool too! [Check it out!](https://google.com) Inline links are super easy and cool too! Check it out! Reference links Using custom tags (for example, [1] , [custom-link] , [pineapple59] ) you can reference links that will be defined at the bottom of the article. This is entirely cosmetic, and viewers can't notice the difference, so it's purely to make editing the document a little bit easier. For example: Here is [a very, very long link][1], [here's another][2], and [one more!][3] <!-- # Link Alt text --> [1]: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHKfrz65KSU/maxresdefault.jpg \"Cute Cats\" [2]: https://d17fnq9dkz9hgj.cloudfront.net/uploads/2018/03/Russian-Blue_01.jpg \"Even more kitties :)\" [3]: https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo?t=2 \"Yet another cute cat :3\" Here is a very, very long link , here's another , and one more! Ignoring markdown In case you just wanna use *normal fancy characters* that would otherwise format text in your document, you can ignore it. There are two ways to ignore Markdown: Using backslashes This is the best way to do it: put a \\ backslash before every Markdown character. This is a _sentence_ written in **Markdown**. This is a sentence written in Markdown . This is \\*\\*\\*NOT\\*\\*\\* a \\_sentence\\_ written in \\*\\*Markdown\\*\\*. This is ***NOT*** a _sentence_ written in **Markdown**. Using code blocks Here's another way to use it: with code blocks. This isn't recommended though, because it visually changes the appearance of the document. You can use code blocks by putting asterisks ( \u200e ` \u200e ) on either side of your text. \u200e `This is **Markdown** _text_.\u200e` This is **Markdown** _text_.
