Markdown is a lightweight text formatting language that you can use to style and format elements on plain documents. Markdown is one of the world's most popular markup languages, and for a reason - its simplicity. Compared to other glorified programs, Markdown doesn't make you move your mouse to click buttons. In fact, I haven't moved my mouse at all while writing this paragraph! Instead, you use asterisks , underscores , and backticks to indicate which parts of the text should look different, You can even embed HTML directly into the doc, and it'll render like a webpage! When you save the document, it gets turned into a super visually pleasant, rich document. In this guide, markdown examples will appear in code blocks, then they will be rendered directly after. This will help you understand Markdown syntax, Before you start writing, it's important to note that text on multiple lines have to have one empty line in between them, otherwise they get squished into a single line. Keep that in mind! Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Useful tools One more thing...
