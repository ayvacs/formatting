## Code boxes

```
Sometimes, it's better to share your code in code boxes, like these!

If you have
    multiple lines,
        code blocks help
            keep everything in
                check. :)

### Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting colours different parts of the text differently, basically displaying it like a rich programming editor. Using syntax highlighting is as simple as writing the language name after the first set of backticks. Some sites don't support it, though.

```html
‎```html
<html>
<body>
  <b>Simple as that!</b>
  <p>Wasn't that <i>easy</i>?!</p>
</body>
</html>
‎```
```

###### Some Markdown editors (like this one) don't support Syntax highlighting.

### Using backticks inside a code box

By typing backticks inside a code box, it will close itself. You can disable this feature by putting an [empty character](https://emptycharacter.com) after the first and last backtick.

Here's how it renders:

```
```‎

✨ *pretzels* ✨

Tasty, doughy treat
    Warm and soft with salt and beer
        Kind of like your mom

```‎
```

And here, the empty characters are denoted with a ⭐️:

```
```‎⭐️

✨ *pretzels* ✨

Tasty, doughy treat
    Warm and soft with salt and beer
        Kind of like your mom

```‎⭐️
```
