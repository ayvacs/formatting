# Quotes

In order to make a quote, start text with a `>` symbol.

```
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
```

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

Multiple quotes will join together if they're placed on separate lines, like so:

```
> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky"

> **- Michael Scott**
```

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky"

> **- Michael Scott**

Quotes on separate lines, one after another, will join into one line, just like regular Markdown text.

```
> Line 1
> Line 2

> Line 3

> Line 4
```

> Line 1
> Line 2

> Line 3

> Line 4

By using a single bracket `>`, all lines touching it after will join into a single quote without the need of using more `>` brackets. However, they will all become a single line.

```
Line 1
>Line 2
Line 3
Line 4

Line 5
```

Line 1
>Line 2
Line 3
Line 4

Line 5

Blockquotes can also be nested:

```
>>> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

>> **- Wayne Gretzky"**

> **- Michael Scott**
```

>>> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

>> **- Wayne Gretzky"**

> **- Michael Scott**
