# Quotes

To make a quote, start text with a `>` symbol.

```
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
```

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

Multiple quotes will join together if they're placed on separate lines, like so:

```
> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky"

> **- Michael Scott**
```

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky"

> **- Michael Scott**

Quotes on separate lines, one after another, will join into one line, just like regular Markdown text.

```
> Line 1
> Line 2

> Line 3

> Line 4
```

> Line 1
> Line 2

> Line 3

> Line 4
