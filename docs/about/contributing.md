# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

All of the project's Markdown files are contained in the [master](https://github.com/sleepiie/formatting) branch, so fork it and make your contributions. After that, you can make a pull request to add the changes. If the pull request is accepted, the changes will be added to the site with the next release.

## Workflow

Here are the steps that a contribution goes through before being added to the site:

```
The contributor forks the **main** branch, makes
their contribution, and makes a pull request.
├ Pull request is accepted
│ ├ The contribution is added to the website's Markdown files
│ └ The contribution becomes visible on the website with the next release.
└ Pull request is denied
```
