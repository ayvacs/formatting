# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

All of the project's Markdown files are contained in the [master](https://github.com/sleepiie/formatting) branch, so fork it and make your contributions. After that, you can make a pull request to add the changes. If the pull request is accepted, the changes will be added to the site with the next release.

## Workflow

Here are the steps that a contribution goes through before being added to the site:

1. Contributor forks the **main** branch, makes their contribution, and makes a pull request.
    1. Pull request is accepted
        1. The contribution is added to the website's Markdown files
        1. The contribution becomes visible on the website with the next release.
    1. Pull request is denied
